Can you imagine anyone else saying *\"Ye baburao ka style hai\"*?\n\n• The famous *\"Utha le re deva\"* dialogue wasn't in the script - Paresh Rawal improvised it during shooting! 🤯\n\n• Akshay Kumar's character name *Raju* was based on director Priyadarshan's friend who was equally mischievous\n\n• The film was a slow starter at the box office but became a cult classic through TV reruns and word of mouth\n\n• The landline phone that's central to the plot was actually a working phone during filming\n\n• The sequel **Phir Hera Pheri** - \"Continued the madness with a new plot involving a get-rich-quick scheme\" was directed by a different filmmaker (Neeraj Vora)\n\nEnjoy your movie night with Baburao, Raju and Shyam! 🥳"}
